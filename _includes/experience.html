                                        I worked as a research intern to build up a Scanning
                                        acoustic microscope from scratch using National Instruments
                                        FPGA and hardware. I also published two papers related to acoustic
                                        imaging during this tenure.
                                        The details of the project and the papers can be viewed in subsequent section.

                                        Developed a hardware system based on NRF52 and ATMEGA 328 to automate the testing procedure for all products.
                                        The device was capable of testing a circuit on parameters such as RF signal strength, Leakage current from
                                        capacitors, current consumption, etc. A complete PCB was designed in KiCad. A python interface was also developed
                                        to monitor all the testing procedures in the company.
                                        The details of the project can be viewed in subsequent section.
